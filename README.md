## Games
I do not approve of piracy and therefore no illegal copies of games are included 
in this pack, only one game is included for two consoles : FlappyBird for GameBoy Advance and Nintendo DS by [Polymars](https://github.com/PolyMarsDev), 
The inclusion of this game in the pack is only for experimental purposes in order to test the functions of the YSMenu and the emulators.

## Cheats
